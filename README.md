## Deliver Us The Moon UEVR Plugin
Deliver Us The Moon is a third person adventure puzzle game which has a first person camera for select narrative sequences only.  This VR mod enables the game's native first person mode for the full campaign and also adds additional VR features including seperately tracked left and right hands.  The Astrotool PDA is now an in-game tool you can interact with directly from your left arm.

## Install
Make sure that you are using the very latest NIGHTLY version of UEVR from: https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/latest/

Delete any previous UEVR profiles for this game.

1. Get the latest release zip and click "Import Config" in UEVR, then browse to the zip and click it.
2. For hiding the cursor, copy the optional PAK file to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deliver Us The Moon\MoonMan\Content\Paks
